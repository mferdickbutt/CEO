## Part 3: Misalignment Detection

This is the most important part of the quarterly review. You're looking for **drift** — places where your actions don't match your stated priorities.

### Compare: What you said you'd prioritize vs. what you actually did

**Review your North Star (`north_star.md`) — what were your top 3 priorities?**

1.
2.
3.

**Now review your calendar and weekly reviews — what did you actually spend time on?**

1.
2.
3.

**Do these lists match?**

If not, why not? Is it:
- [ ] You got pulled into firefighting (reactive, not intentional)
- [ ] Your stated priorities were wrong (you discovered better priorities)
- [ ] You avoided the hard thing (procrastination or fear)
- [ ] External circumstances changed (funding, market, team)
- [ ] You drifted without noticing (no accountability)

**Your answer:**

---

### Where are you out of alignment?

**Work vs. stated priorities:**

**Time vs. energy:**
*Are you spending time on things that drain you without return?*

**Effort vs. outcomes:**
*Are you working hard but not seeing results? Where is leverage missing?*

**Your answer:**

## Part 4: Energy vs. Output Analysis

### Energy Audit

**Average energy this quarter (1-10):** ___

**Compare to last quarter:** [Higher / Same / Lower]

**What consistently gave you energy this quarter?**

**What consistently drained you?**

**Are you managing energy or depleting it?**

---

### Output Audit

**Rate your output this quarter (1-10):** ___
*Not effort. Output. Did you produce meaningful results?*

**What was your highest-leverage work this quarter?**
*The work that created the most value per unit of effort*

**What was your lowest-leverage work this quarter?**
*The work that consumed time/energy but produced little value*

---

### Energy vs. Output Matrix

Plot your major activities this quarter:

| Activity | Energy (High/Low) | Output (High/Low) | Quadrant |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Example: Product strategy | High | High | **Maintain** |
| Example: Status meetings | Low | Low | **Eliminate** |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Quadrants:**
- **High Energy, High Output** → Maintain, protect, do more of this
- **High Energy, Low Output** → Fun but not productive — limit or eliminate
- **Low Energy, High Output** → Leverage opportunity — systemize or delegate
- **Low Energy, Low Output** → Eliminate immediately

**What will you eliminate or delegate based on this?**

| Health | | | ↑/↓/→ | |
| Meaning | | | ↑/↓/→ | |

## Why Quarterly Reviews Matter

Quarterly reviews catch drift before it becomes disaster.

Without them, you'll:
- Work on the wrong things for 6-12 months before noticing
- Burn out because you're not managing energy
- Miss the gap between effort and output
- Let one dimension of life collapse while focusing on another

**Quarterly reviews are course correction. Use them.**
