## How to Use Daily Check-Ins

1. **Create a new file each day:** `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-12-31.md`)
2. **Copy this template** or answer the questions from memory
3. **Spend no more than 5 minutes** — this is a snapshot, not a journal
4. **Don't skip the "let go" question** — it's the most important one
5. **Review these weekly** to spot patterns (energy trends, recurring friction, what actually matters)

## What This Reveals Over Time

After 30-90 days of daily check-ins, you'll see:
- **Energy patterns** — which days, activities, or people consistently drain or energize you
- **What actually matters** — your "meaningful wins" will reveal your real priorities vs. stated priorities
- **Recurring friction** — the same problems appearing over and over (those need structural fixes, not willpower)
- **Follow-through** — are your "one priorities" aligned with your goals, or are you constantly firefighting?

**This data is gold. Use it in your weekly and quarterly reviews.**
