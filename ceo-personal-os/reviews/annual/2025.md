## Why This Matters

Most people never do an honest annual review. They make vague resolutions in January, forget them by February, and wonder why nothing changes.

**You just did the work most people avoid.**

You looked at the data. You acknowledged what worked and what didn't. You identified patterns. You let go of what's holding you back. You set intent for the future.

**This is how you improve. This is how you design a life instead of just reacting to one.**

Now act on what you learned.
