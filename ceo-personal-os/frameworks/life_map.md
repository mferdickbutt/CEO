# Life Map Framework

**Based on Alex Lieberman's 6-Dimension Life Framework**

Alex Lieberman, co-founder of Morning Brew, developed this framework to evaluate life holistically across six dimensions. The idea: most high performers over-index on work and under-index on everything else. Over time, this creates fragility, burnout, and regret.

This framework helps you see where you're out of balance and make intentional choices about how to allocate energy across your whole life — not just your company.

## The Six Dimensions

1. **Career** — Your work, impact, and professional identity
2. **Relationships** — Family, friends, romantic partnership, community
3. **Health** — Physical fitness, mental health, energy, longevity
4. **Meaning** — Purpose, values, contribution, spirituality (if relevant)
5. **Finances** — Income, savings, investments, financial security
6. **Fun** — Adventure, play, hobbies, joy, novelty

## Why This Matters

Most CEOs live in a 2-dimension world: **Career** and **Finances**.

Everything else gets deferred:
- "I'll prioritize health after the fundraise."
- "I'll travel after the exit."
- "I'll reconnect with friends when things slow down."

Things never slow down.

And when you finally have the success you were chasing, you realize:
- Your relationships have atrophied
- Your health is compromised
- You forgot what fun feels like
- You're not sure what it was all for

**This framework prevents that.**

It helps you design a life where all six dimensions are at least minimally viable, and 2-3 are thriving.

You don't need a 10/10 in everything. But you do need to avoid prolonged 2/10s.

## How to Use the Life Map

### Step 1: Rate Each Dimension (Current State)

For each dimension, rate where you are **right now** on a scale of 1-10.

**Be honest.** This is for you, not for anyone else.

| Dimension | Rating (1-10) | Why this rating? (one sentence) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| **Career** | | |
| **Relationships** | | |
| **Health** | | |
| **Meaning** | | |
| **Finances** | | |
| **Fun** | | |

**Total score:** _____ / 60

---

### Step 2: Reflect on Each Dimension

Answer these prompts for each dimension. Be specific.

#### Career

**Current state:**
- What's working in your work right now?
- What's not working?
- Are you doing work that energizes you or drains you?
- Are you building leverage, or just staying busy?

**What would a 10/10 look like for you in Career?**

**What would it take to move from [current rating] to [current + 2]?**

---

#### Relationships

**Current state:**
- Who are the 5-10 people who matter most to you?
- How much quality time did you spend with them in the last month?
- Are your relationships deepening or drifting?
- Where are you underinvesting?

**What would a 10/10 look like for you in Relationships?**

**What would it take to move from [current rating] to [current + 2]?**

---

#### Health

**Current state:**
- How's your physical health? (energy, fitness, sleep, nutrition)
- How's your mental health? (stress, anxiety, clarity, resilience)
- Are you building long-term health or borrowing against it?

**What would a 10/10 look like for you in Health?**

**What would it take to move from [current rating] to [current + 2]?**

---

#### Meaning

**Current state:**
- Do you feel like your work matters?
- Are you living according to your values?
- Do you have a sense of purpose beyond making money?
- Are you contributing to something larger than yourself?

**What would a 10/10 look like for you in Meaning?**

**What would it take to move from [current rating] to [current + 2]?**

---

#### Finances

**Current state:**
- Do you have financial security? (6-12 months of expenses saved)
- Are you earning enough to sustain your lifestyle?
- Are you investing for the future?
- Do you have clarity on what "enough" is?

**What would a 10/10 look like for you in Finances?**

**What would it take to move from [current rating] to [current + 2]?**

---

#### Fun

**Current state:**
- When was the last time you did something purely for enjoyment?
- Do you have hobbies outside of work?
- Are you experiencing novelty and adventure?
- Do you laugh regularly?

**What would a 10/10 look like for you in Fun?**

**What would it take to move from [current rating] to [current + 2]?**

---

### Step 3: Identify Imbalances

Look at your ratings. Where are the imbalances?

**Danger zones (1-4):**
These need immediate attention. You can't sustain a 2/10 in Health or Relationships indefinitely without consequences.

**Your danger zones:**

**Underdeveloped (5-6):**
Not broken, but not thriving. These are often the first to slip when work gets busy.

**Your underdeveloped areas:**

**Thriving (8-10):**
What's working well that you want to protect?

**Your thriving areas:**

---

### Step 4: Set Dimension-Specific Goals

You can't fix everything at once. Pick 1-2 dimensions to focus on in the next quarter.

**Focus dimensions for next 90 days:**
1.
2.

**For each focus dimension, set one specific, measurable goal:**

**Dimension 1:**
- **Goal:**
- **Why this matters:**
- **How you'll measure success:**
- **What you'll do weekly to move this forward:**

**Dimension 2:**
- **Goal:**
- **Why this matters:**
- **How you'll measure success:**
- **What you'll do weekly to move this forward:**

---

### Step 5: Protect What's Thriving

It's easy to let thriving areas slip when you focus on fixing broken ones.

**What's thriving that you want to protect?**

**What habits or routines are maintaining this?**

**How will you ensure you don't let this slip?**

---

## How to Use This Framework Over Time

**Quarterly:** Re-rate all six dimensions. Track trends. Are things improving or degrading?

**Annually:** Deep dive into each dimension using the prompts above. Set goals for the year.

**When making big decisions:** Ask yourself — how will this decision impact each dimension? Am I willing to accept a 3/10 in Health to get Career to a 10? For how long?

## Common Patterns for CEOs

**Pattern 1: The Lopsided Founder**
- Career: 9/10
- Finances: 8/10
- Everything else: 3-5/10

**What happens:** You build a successful company and lose everything else. When you finally slow down, you realize you have money but no relationships, no health, and no idea what you enjoy.

**Fix:** Set minimum viable thresholds for non-work dimensions. "I will not let Health drop below a 6." "I will not let Relationships drop below a 5."

---

**Pattern 2: The Meaning Crisis**
- Career: 8/10 (successful, but feels hollow)
- Finances: 9/10
- Meaning: 3/10

**What happens:** You're "successful" by external metrics but feel empty. You built something that makes money but doesn't matter to you.

**Fix:** Reconnect with why you started. Realign work with values. Consider a pivot, or adding a dimension of impact (teaching, mentoring, giving).

---

**Pattern 3: The Burnout Track**
- Career: 7/10 (working hard, not thriving)
- Health: 3/10
- Fun: 2/10

**What happens:** You're grinding without recovery. Energy is depleting. Performance starts to slip. Everything feels heavy.

**Fix:** Rest is not optional. Block time for recovery. Reintroduce fun. Health is the foundation — fix it first.

---

**Pattern 4: The Balanced Baseline**
- All dimensions: 6-7/10

**What happens:** Nothing is broken, nothing is exceptional. You're stable but not growing.

**Fix:** This might be fine. Or it might be mediocrity. Decide if you're okay with this, or if you want to spike one dimension to a 9-10.

---

## Alex Lieberman's Key Insight

"You can have imbalance for seasons — a quarter, maybe a year. But prolonged imbalance creates fragility. One dimension collapses and takes the others with it."

**Translation for CEOs:**
- You can go all-in on Career during a fundraise or product launch.
- But if you stay there for 3 years, your Health will break, your Relationships will atrophy, and your Meaning will evaporate.
- And when that happens, Career suffers too.

The goal is not perfect balance. It's **intentional imbalance** — choosing where to spike, protecting minimums everywhere else, and rebalancing over time.

## Visualization: The Life Map Wheel

Draw a simple six-spoke wheel. Rate each dimension and shade in the area.

```
         Career (9)
             |
     Meaning |-------- Relationships (4)
         \   |   /
          \  |  /
    Finances-●-Health (3)
          /  |  \
         /   |   \
       Fun (2)
```

A balanced life is a roughly circular wheel. A lopsided one has spikes and valleys.

**Your wheel doesn't need to be a perfect circle. But it should be round enough to roll forward without collapsing.**
