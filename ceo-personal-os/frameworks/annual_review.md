# Annual Review Framework

**Based on Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review Process**

This framework helps you conduct a deep, structured reflection on the past year and set clear intent for the year ahead. It's designed to surface patterns, celebrate wins you might have missed, acknowledge failures honestly, and make intentional decisions about the future.

Dr. Anthony Gustin, entrepreneur and physician, developed this process to replace vague New Year's resolutions with data-driven, pattern-based life design. The core idea: your past behavior is your best predictor of future behavior unless you actively change the conditions.

## When to Use This Framework

**Timing:** Late December or early January
**Duration:** 3-4 uninterrupted hours (minimum)
**Environment:** Quiet space, no distractions, paper or digital — whatever helps you think

---

## The Annual Review Process

### Part 1: Data Collection (30 minutes)

Before you reflect, gather data. You can't see patterns without information.

**Review these sources:**
- Calendar (last 12 months) — who you spent time with, what you worked on
- Financial records — income, expenses, investments, major purchases
- Photos — what moments mattered enough to capture?
- Notes, journals, past reviews (if you have them)
- Travel history
- Books read, podcasts consumed, courses taken
- Health data (if tracked)
- Emails sent/received (scan for themes)

**Don't analyze yet. Just collect.**

### Part 2: Positive Reflection (45 minutes)

#### What Went Well

List everything that went well this year. Small and large. Professional and personal.

Prompts:
- What are you most proud of?
- What exceeded your expectations?
- What brought you energy?
- What relationships deepened?
- What skills did you develop?
- What risks paid off?
- What problems did you solve?
- What did you create that didn't exist before?
- What made you laugh?
- Where did you grow?

**Aim for at least 20 items.** Go deeper than surface-level wins.

#### Peak Experiences

What were the top 5-10 experiences of the year?

Not accomplishments — **experiences**. Moments when you felt fully alive, aligned, energized, or deeply satisfied.

**For each peak experience, ask:**
- What made this special?
- Who was involved?
- What conditions enabled this?
- Can you create more of this?

---

### Part 3: Negative Reflection (45 minutes)

This is where most people skip or go surface-level. Don't. Honest failure analysis is the highest-leverage part of this process.

#### What Went Poorly

List everything that didn't work, drained you, or failed.

Prompts:
- What did you avoid dealing with?
- What disappointed you?
- What took energy without return?
- What goals did you miss?
- What relationships suffered?
- What habits did you fail to build (or break)?
- What decisions do you regret?
- Where did you settle?
- What made you angry or resentful?
- Where did you compromise your values?

**Be specific.** "Didn't exercise enough" is weak. "Joined a gym in January, went 4 times, never canceled, paid $600 for nothing" is useful data.

#### Trough Experiences

What were the worst 5-10 experiences of the year?

Moments when you felt depleted, misaligned, resentful, or stuck.

**For each trough experience, ask:**
- What made this difficult?
- What was in your control vs. not in your control?
- What would you do differently?
- What were the warning signs you ignored?
- Can you prevent this in the future?

### Part 4: Pattern Recognition (30 minutes)

Now step back and look for patterns across both positive and negative reflections.

#### Recurring Themes

**Positive patterns** — what keeps working for you?
*e.g., "I perform best with 1:1 coaching," "Deep work sessions in the morning are 10x more productive than afternoon work," "I solve hard problems by writing, not talking"*

List 3-5 positive patterns:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Negative patterns** — what keeps not working?
*e.g., "Every time I hire fast, I regret it," "I overcommit in Q4 every year," "I avoid hard financial conversations until they become crises"*

List 3-5 negative patterns:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Write these down in memory.md** — they're your instruction manual.

### Part 5: Category-Based Review (30 minutes)

Evaluate the year across key life dimensions. Rate each 1-10, then write one sentence of context.

| Category | Rating (1-10) | One-sentence context |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Health & Energy** | | |
| **Relationships** | | |
| **Work & Impact** | | |
| **Financial** | | |
| **Learning & Growth** | | |
| **Fun & Adventure** | | |
| **Meaning & Purpose** | | |

**Look for imbalances.** A 9 in work and a 3 in health is not sustainable. A 10 in finances and a 2 in relationships is a choice — is it the right one?

---

### Part 6: Future Design (45 minutes)

Now that you understand the past, design the future.

#### If This Year Repeated 10 Times

If the year you just had repeated 10 times, would you be satisfied with your life?

**Yes or no. Then explain why.**

This question forces honesty. If the answer is no, something fundamental needs to change.

#### What to Stop, Start, Continue

**Stop:**
What will you explicitly stop doing next year?
*Be specific. "Stop overworking" is weak. "Stop taking calls after 6pm" is actionable.*

1.
2.
3.

**Start:**
What will you explicitly start doing next year?

1.
2.
3.

**Continue:**
What's working that you want to protect and maintain?

1.
2.
3.

#### Word of the Year

If you had to choose one word to guide your next year, what would it be?

**Your word:** _______________

**Why this word:**

*Examples: Focus, Build, Rest, Connect, Simplify, Courage, Momentum, Clarity*

---

### Part 7: Integration

Now tie it together.

**Summarize your year in 3-5 sentences:**
*What was this year about? What did you learn? Where are you now?*

**Set intent for next year in 3-5 sentences:**
*What is next year about? What are you optimizing for? What does success look like?*

**Write this summary at the top of your annual review file in `reviews/annual/YYYY.md`**

---

## After the Annual Review

1. **Update your goals** (`goals/1_year.md`, `goals/3_year.md`, `goals/10_year.md`)
2. **Update your Life Map** (`frameworks/life_map.md`)
3. **Refresh your Vivid Vision** (`frameworks/vivid_vision.md`)
4. **Update memory.md** with key patterns
5. **Update north_star.md** with new priorities

---

## Why This Works

Most people don't reflect at all. They react.

The ones who do reflect often do it vaguely — "I should work out more," "I want to be happier."

This framework forces specificity. It surfaces patterns. It separates what worked from what didn't. It turns insight into intent.

Your past contains all the data you need to design your future. You just have to look at it honestly.
