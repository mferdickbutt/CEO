# Vivid Vision Framework

**Inspired by Tony Robbins and Cameron Herold**

A Vivid Vision is a detailed, sensory-rich description of your ideal future. It's not a goal list. It's not a mission statement. It's a narrative that makes the future feel real — so real that your brain starts solving for it.

This framework helps you design what you want with enough clarity that you can feel it, see it, and move toward it with conviction.

## What Is a Vivid Vision?

A Vivid Vision is a written description of your ideal life 3 years from now, written in present tense, as if it's already happening.

It includes:
- What you're doing day-to-day
- Who you're surrounded by
- What your work looks like
- How you feel
- What you've built
- What you've let go of
- Sensory details — what you see, hear, feel

**Why present tense?**
Because your brain doesn't distinguish well between imagination and reality. If you describe the future as if it's real, your subconscious starts building the path to it.

**Why 3 years?**
Long enough to be transformational. Short enough to feel achievable. Not so far that it's fantasy.

## When to Use This Framework

- **Annual review time** — refresh or rewrite your Vivid Vision
- **Major life transitions** — new company, new role, new stage of life
- **When you feel stuck** — a clear future vision creates pull
- **When making big decisions** — does this move you toward the vision or away from it?

## How to Write a Vivid Vision

### Step 1: Choose Your Time Horizon

**Default: 3 years from today**

What date will it be? **[DATE]**

### Step 2: Choose Your Domains

You don't have to write about everything. Focus on what matters most right now.

Choose 3-6 domains:
- Work / Company
- Health / Energy
- Relationships / Family
- Financial
- Location / Lifestyle
- Impact / Legacy
- Learning / Growth
- Adventure / Fun

**Your chosen domains:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

### Step 3: Write in Present Tense, First Person

**Write as if you're living the life right now.**

Use sensory details. Be specific. Make it real.

**Weak:** "I am successful and happy."
**Strong:** "I wake up at 6am without an alarm. I'm energized. I spend the first hour writing — no email, no Slack. By 7am I've made progress on something that matters. The company runs without me in the day-to-day. I have a team of 8 leaders who own their domains. I spend my time on strategy, board work, and the 2-3 decisions only I can make. I'm home for dinner 5 nights a week."

It's December 2028. The company is at $25M ARR, growing 60% year-over-year, profitable. We have 45 people. I know all their names, but I don't manage any of them directly. My leadership team — 6 people I trust completely — runs the day-to-day. They make decisions without me. I'm in 5-7 hours of meetings per week, all strategic. The rest of my time is thinking, writing, and working on 2-3 big bets only I can drive.

We have product-market fit in two verticals. Our customers renew at 95%+ because the product works and the team cares. I'm not in Slack daily. I'm not the bottleneck. I've built a company that doesn't need me to function, which means I can focus on the things only I can do: vision, culture, capital allocation, and the next stage of scale.

I spend one week per quarter fully offline — no laptop, no phone. The company doesn't break. I come back with clarity and energy. My board respects me. I respect myself. I'm building something that will outlast me.

## After You Write Your Vivid Vision

1. **Read it weekly.** Sunday evening or Monday morning. Let it sink in.
2. **Update it when it changes.** Your vision will evolve. That's fine.
3. **Use it to make decisions.** When faced with a choice, ask: does this move me toward the vision or away from it?
4. **Share it selectively.** With a coach, a co-founder, a trusted advisor. Not with everyone.
5. **Measure against it quarterly.** Are you moving toward this or drifting away?

---

## Why This Works

Goals are intellectual. Vivid Visions are emotional.

When you can **feel** the future, your brain starts building the path. You notice opportunities you would have missed. You say no to things that don't fit. You make different decisions.

This isn't manifestation. This is clarity. And clarity is the highest-leverage asset you have.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being vague.** "I am happy and successful" tells you nothing. Be specific.
2. **Writing what you think you should want.** Write what you actually want.
3. **Focusing only on work.** Your life is more than your company.
4. **Writing once and forgetting it.** This is a tool. Use it.
5. **Making it a goal list.** This is a narrative, not a checklist.
