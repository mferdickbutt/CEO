# Ideal Lifestyle Costing

**Based on Tim Ferriss's "Dreamline" Exercise from** ***The 4-Hour Workweek***

Most people overestimate what they need to be happy and underestimate what it costs to maintain their current lifestyle.

This framework helps you:
1. Define what your ideal lifestyle actually looks like (not vaguely, but specifically)
2. Calculate what it costs (monthly and annually)
3. Realize it's probably more achievable than you think

The goal is not to optimize for maximum wealth. It's to optimize for **enough** — and to know what enough is.

## Why This Matters for CEOs

You're building a company. You're optimizing for growth, scale, revenue, valuation.

But if you don't know what you're building **for** — what lifestyle you're trying to unlock — you'll keep moving the goalposts forever.

$1M ARR becomes $5M becomes $20M becomes "maybe after the exit."

This exercise forces you to answer: **What is the life I'm actually trying to design? And what does it cost?**

Once you know that, you can make different decisions about:
- How big the company needs to be
- Whether to raise capital
- Whether to sell
- How much risk to take
- When "enough" is enough

## The Exercise

### Step 1: Define Your Ideal Lifestyle (6-12 Months from Now)

Not 10 years from now. Not "someday." **What would your ideal life look like 6-12 months from now if money weren't the primary constraint?**

Answer these questions:

#### Daily Routine

**What time do you wake up?**

**What do you do in the morning?**

**How many hours do you work, and on what?**

**What do you do in the evening?**

**Who do you spend time with?**

#### Work

**What does your work look like?**
*e.g., CEO of current company but with a leadership team, advisor to 3 companies, full-time investor, retired from operations, building a new project*

**How many hours per week are you working?**

**What type of work are you doing?**
*Strategy, fundraising, building, writing, coaching, teaching, nothing*

**Where are you working from?**

#### Location & Living Situation

**Where do you live?**
*City, neighborhood, type of home*

**Do you rent or own?**

**What does your home look like?**
*Size, style, must-haves*

**Do you have multiple locations?**
*e.g., primary home + cabin, US + international, nomadic*

#### Health & Fitness

**What does your health routine look like?**
*Daily exercise, type of training, nutrition approach*

**Do you have a personal trainer, chef, or other support?**

**How much do you sleep?**

#### Relationships & Social Life

**How much time do you spend with family?**

**How often do you see friends?**

**What does your social life look like?**

**Do you host, travel to see people, both?**

#### Travel & Adventure

**How many trips per year?**

**What kind of travel?**
*Work, leisure, adventure, mix*

**Where do you go?**

**How do you travel?**
*Economy, business, first class, private*

#### Learning & Growth

**What are you learning?**

**How are you growing?**
*Coaching, courses, reading, masterminds*

**What skills are you developing?**

#### Possessions & Purchases

**What do you own that matters to you?**
*Not what you think you should want — what you actually want*

**What would you buy in the next 6-12 months?**
*Car, home, equipment, art, experiences*

**What would you stop buying?**

### Step 2: Cost Your Ideal Lifestyle

Now put real numbers to it. **Be honest.** Underestimating doesn't help you.

Use this table:

| Category | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Housing** (rent/mortgage, utilities, maintenance) | $ | $ | |
| **Food** (groceries, dining out) | $ | $ | |
| **Transportation** (car payment, insurance, gas, Uber, flights) | $ | $ | |
| **Health & Fitness** (gym, trainer, supplements, healthcare) | $ | $ | |
| **Family & Dependents** (childcare, education, support) | $ | $ | |
| **Travel** (flights, hotels, experiences) | $ | $ | |
| **Learning & Growth** (coaching, courses, books) | $ | $ | |
| **Entertainment & Fun** (hobbies, dining, events) | $ | $ | |
| **Clothing & Personal** | $ | $ | |
| **Insurance** (health, life, disability, property) | $ | $ | |
| **Savings & Investments** (retirement, brokerage, emergency fund) | $ | $ | |
| **Giving** (charity, family support, community) | $ | $ | |
| **Other** | $ | $ | |
| **TOTAL** | **$** | **$** | |

**Add 20% buffer for unknowns and variability.**

**Final number:** $__________ per month / $__________ per year

### Step 3: Calculate Your Target Monthly Income (TMI)

To sustain this lifestyle, what do you need to earn monthly (after taxes)?

**Rough formula:**
- Annual cost ÷ 12 = monthly cost
- Monthly cost ÷ 0.6 = gross monthly income needed (assumes ~40% tax rate)
- Adjust based on your actual tax situation

**Your Target Monthly Income (TMI):** $__________

---

### Step 4: Reality Check

Now compare this number to your current situation.

**Current monthly income (post-tax):** $__________

**Gap (if any):** $__________

**Is the gap smaller than you expected?** Most people are surprised.

**If there's a gap, how do you close it?**
- Increase revenue in current business
- Take a salary from the company
- Reduce costs in current lifestyle
- Shift to higher-leverage work
- Exit current business and do something else

**If there's no gap (you're already there or close):**
- Are you living the ideal lifestyle, or just making the money?
- If not, what's stopping you?
- What would you need to change?

---

### Step 5: Design Backwards

Now that you know what your ideal lifestyle costs, you can design backwards.

**If your ideal life costs $15k/month post-tax:**
- You need ~$25k/month pre-tax
- You need ~$300k/year in income
- If you own a business, what revenue/profit supports that?
- If you sell equity, what amount would sustain this for 10+ years?

**This clarity changes everything.**

It means you know when you have enough.
It means you know what you're building for.
It means you can make decisions based on life design, not just growth for growth's sake.

## Tim Ferriss's Key Insights (Adapted for CEOs)

1. **Most people overestimate the cost of their ideal life.**
   The things that matter — time, health, relationships, autonomy — are often cheaper than the things you're spending on now.

2. **Income is only useful if it buys time and autonomy.**
   A $500k/year job that owns your life is worse than a $150k/year role with freedom.

3. **Lifestyle design is not about retirement.**
   It's about designing the life you want now, then building the business model to support it.

4. **The opposite of happiness is not sadness; it's boredom.**
   If your ideal life doesn't include challenge, growth, and contribution, you'll be miserable.

5. **Enough is a number. Define it.**
   If you don't know what enough is, you'll never get there.

## How to Use This Framework

**Do this exercise:**
- Annually (during your annual review)
- When considering a major decision (raise capital, sell the company, take a job, quit a job)
- When you feel unmoored or unclear about why you're working

**Update it when:**
- Your life stage changes (new family, kids grow up, health shifts)
- Your priorities change
- You realize your ideal life has evolved

**Reference it when:**
- Evaluating opportunities (does this move me toward the ideal life or away from it?)
- Feeling burned out (am I optimizing for money I don't need instead of the life I want?)
- Making financial decisions (is this expense aligned with my ideal lifestyle?)

---

## Common Realizations from This Exercise

- "I'm already making enough. I just need to change how I spend my time."
- "My ideal life costs less than I thought. I'm closer than I realized."
- "I don't actually want the things I'm working toward."
- "I'm optimizing for someone else's definition of success."
- "I need to make more money, but not as much as I feared."
- "I'm spending on things I don't care about and underinvesting in things I do."
