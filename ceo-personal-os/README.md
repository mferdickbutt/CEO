# CEO Personal Operating System

A private, single-user productivity system designed for founders, CEOs, and operators who want clarity without complexity.

This is not software. This is a **system** — a structured approach to reflection, goal-setting, and decision-making that helps you see patterns, maintain focus, and design the life you actually want.

## What This System Does

- **Daily check-ins** (5 minutes): Track energy, wins, friction, and priorities
- **Weekly reviews** (20 minutes): Separate signal from noise, identify what moved the needle
- **Quarterly reviews** (90 minutes): Evaluate goals, detect misalignment, adjust course
- **Annual reviews** (half-day): Deep reflection, pattern recognition, intent-setting for the year ahead
- **Guided self-interviews**: Thoughtful prompts that surface blind spots and clarify values
- **Framework-based thinking**: Proven mental models adapted for executive decision-making
- **Pattern tracking**: Ingests past reviews and notes to identify recurring themes, strengths, and failure modes
- **Long-term life design**: 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year goal mapping across all life dimensions

## How to Use This System

### First-Time Setup (15 minutes)

1. **Personalize your North Star**
   Open `north_star.md` and replace placeholders with your actual context:
   - [YOUR COMPANY] → your company name
   - [YOUR ROLE] → CEO, Founder, etc.
   - [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE] → early-stage founder, scaling CEO, second-time founder, etc.
   - [YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES] → 2-3 big priorities right now

2. **Complete your first interview**
   Start with `interviews/identity_and_values.md`. Answer the questions in your own words. Be honest — no one else will see this.

3. **Optional: Upload past context**
   If you have old annual reviews, performance reviews, or reflection notes:
   - Drop them in `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`
   - Run through them yourself and note patterns in `memory.md`

### Daily Rhythm (5 minutes, end of day)

1. Create a new file in `reviews/daily/` named with today's date: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Copy the template from any existing daily review or create from scratch using these prompts:
   - Energy level (1-10)
   - One meaningful win today
   - One friction point or energy drain
   - One thing to let go of
   - One priority for tomorrow
3. Save and close

**That's it.** No dashboards. No analytics. Just a written record you can scan later for patterns.

### Weekly Rhythm (20 minutes, Friday afternoon or Sunday evening)

1. Create a new file in `reviews/weekly/` named: `YYYY-Www.md` (e.g., `2025-W01.md`)
2. Use the template in any existing weekly review file, or answer:
   - What moved the needle this week?
   - What was noise?
   - Where did time leak?
   - One strategic insight
   - One adjustment for next week
3. Scan your daily check-ins from the week for patterns

### Quarterly Rhythm (90 minutes, last week of quarter)

1. Create a new file in `reviews/quarterly/` named: `YYYY-Qn.md` (e.g., `2025-Q1.md`)
2. Use the template provided
3. Review your weekly reviews from the quarter
4. Evaluate goal progress against `goals/1_year.md`
5. Detect misalignment between effort and outcomes
6. Make course corrections

### Annual Rhythm (half-day, late December or early January)

1. Create a new file in `reviews/annual/` named: `YYYY.md` (e.g., `2025.md`)
2. Block 3-4 uninterrupted hours
3. Follow the Annual Review template (based on Dr. Anthony Gustin's framework)
4. Complete the `interviews/past_year_reflection.md` and `interviews/future_self_interview.md`
5. Update your Life Map (`frameworks/life_map.md`)
6. Refresh your Vivid Vision (`frameworks/vivid_vision.md`)
7. Revisit Ideal Lifestyle Costing (`frameworks/ideal_life_costing.md`)
8. Set or update goals in `goals/1_year.md`, `goals/3_year.md`, `goals/10_year.md`
9. Update `memory.md` with key patterns from the year
10. Write a clear narrative summary at the top of your annual review

## Philosophy

This system is built on three beliefs:

1. **Clarity beats complexity**
   You don't need more tools. You need better questions and consistent reflection.

2. **Patterns reveal truth**
   What you repeat — both successes and failures — tells you more than any single decision.

3. **The CEO's job is energy allocation**
   Your most valuable resource is not time or money. It's your attention and energy. This system helps you see where it's going and whether that's serving you.

## What This System Is Not

- Not a project management tool (use Asana, Linear, Notion for that)
- Not a time tracker (use your calendar)
- Not a habit tracker (use Streaks, Way of Life, or paper)
- Not a journaling app (this is structured reflection, not freeform writing)
- Not therapy (though it may surface things worth discussing with a coach or therapist)

## Tone and Approach

This system uses a calm, direct, executive-level voice. It assumes you're intelligent, self-aware, and short on time. There's no hustle culture here. No productivity theater. No corporate jargon.

The questions are designed to surface insight, not to judge you. Answer them honestly. Skip anything that doesn't serve you. Adapt ruthlessly.

This is **your** system. Make it work for you.
