# Interview: Identity and Values

This interview helps you clarify who you are, what matters to you, and what you stand for.

It's designed to surface the beliefs and principles that guide your decisions — especially the ones you might not have articulated before.

**How to use this:**
- Block 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Answer in writing (not just in your head)
- Be honest — no one else will see this
- Revisit this annually or whenever your sense of self shifts

## Why This Interview Matters

Most people operate on autopilot. They make decisions based on what they think they should do, what others expect, or what seems like the default path.

This interview forces you to articulate what *you* believe, what *you* value, and who *you* are.

Once you have that clarity, decisions get easier. You know what to say yes to. You know what to say no to. You know when you're drifting.

And when you're unclear, you have something to come back to.

**This is your foundation. Protect it.**
