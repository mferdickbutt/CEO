# Interview: Past Year Reflection

This is a guided self-interview designed to help you reflect deeply on the past year.

**How to use this:**
- Block 60-90 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Answer in writing, in order
- Don't rush — sit with the hard questions
- This is for you, not for anyone else
- Do this annually (late December or early January)

## Why This Interview Works

Most year-end reflections are surface-level:
- "What went well?"
- "What could be better?"
- "What are your goals for next year?"

This interview goes deeper. It asks:
- What patterns are you repeating?
- What are you avoiding?
- What are you proud of that no one sees?
- If this year repeated, would you be satisfied?

**These questions surface truth.**

And truth — however uncomfortable — is the foundation of change.
