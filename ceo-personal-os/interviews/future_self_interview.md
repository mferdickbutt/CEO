# Interview: Future Self

This is an unusual exercise. You're going to interview yourself from the future.

Imagine it's 3 years from now. You've built the life and company you wanted. Things worked out. You made the right calls. You're proud of where you are.

**Now, from that future version of yourself, answer these questions to your current self.**

This exercise works because it bypasses your current limitations and doubts. Your future self has perspective you don't have yet. Listen to them.

## Why This Interview Works

Your current self is constrained by:
- Fear of failure
- Uncertainty about the future
- Current stress and noise
- Imposter syndrome
- Decision fatigue

Your future self — even an imagined one — has perspective.

They know what mattered and what didn't. They know what worked. They made the hard calls and survived.

**This exercise lets you borrow that perspective before you have it.**

It won't give you perfect answers. But it will often surface what you already know deep down and haven't acted on yet.

---

## How to Use This

- **Do this exercise annually** as part of your annual review
- **Do it when you're stuck** on a major decision
- **Do it when you're burned out** and need to remember why you're doing this
- **Revisit old future self interviews** — did your predictions come true? What did you get right? What did you miss?

Over time, you'll get better at hearing your future self. And your future self will get better at guiding you.

**Listen to them. They know something you don't.**
