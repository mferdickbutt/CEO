## Why 10 Years?

10 years is your **life design time horizon**.

It's far enough away that anything is possible:
- You can build a category-defining company
- You can master a completely new domain
- You can reinvent your career
- You can transform your health, relationships, wealth
- You can design and live a life radically different from today

But it's close enough to feel real. In 10 years:
- You'll be [YOUR AGE + 10] years old
- Your kids (if you have them) will be [THEIR AGE + 10]
- The decisions you make today will compound into undeniable outcomes

**This is not a prediction. This is a design exercise.**

You're not forecasting the future. You're **choosing** it.

## Context

## Final Thought

Most people never design their life. They just react to it.

You're doing something rare: you're **choosing** what you want 10 years from now and working backwards.

The vision won't unfold exactly as written. That's not the point.

The point is to have a direction — a North Star that helps you make decisions, say no to distractions, and stay aligned with what actually matters to you.

**This is your 10-year bet. Make it count.**
