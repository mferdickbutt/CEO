## Why 3 Years?

3 years is long enough to be transformational but short enough to feel real.

In 3 years you can:
- Build a company from $0 to $10M+ ARR
- Completely change careers
- Develop deep expertise in a new domain
- Transform your health, relationships, or financial position
- Design and live a fundamentally different life

But 3 years is also short enough that the future version of yourself feels **reachable**. You can visualize it. You can plan for it. You can hold yourself accountable to it.

**This is your strategic time horizon.**
