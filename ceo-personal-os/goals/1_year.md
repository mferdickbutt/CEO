## Context

Before setting goals, ground yourself:

**What stage are you in?**
*Business stage, life stage, where you are right now*

**What are you optimizing for this year?**
*Growth, profitability, sustainability, transition, learning, rest — what's the primary optimization?*

**What constraints are you working within?**
*Capital, team size, market conditions, personal capacity*

## Goal-Setting Framework

**Good goals are:**
- **Specific** — you know exactly what success looks like
- **Measurable** — you can track progress
- **Achievable** — ambitious but realistic given your constraints
- **Relevant** — aligned with your longer-term vision
- **Time-bound** — clear deadline (in this case, 12 months)

**Avoid:**
- Vague aspirations ("be healthier")
- Goals you can't control ("raise a Series A")
- Too many goals (3-5 is ideal, 10 is too many)
- Goals that don't actually matter to you

## Balance Check

Look at the categories of your goals:

**Career:** ___ goals
**Relationships:** ___ goals
**Health:** ___ goals
**Meaning:** ___ goals
**Finances:** ___ goals
**Fun:** ___ goals

**Are you over-indexed on one dimension?**

**Is this intentional, or is it drift?**
