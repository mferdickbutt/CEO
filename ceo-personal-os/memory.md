# Memory: Pattern Tracking & Insights

This file is your **personal pattern database**. It's where you track recurring themes, insights, strengths, blind spots, and failure modes that emerge over time.

Your past behavior is your best predictor of future behavior — unless you actively change the conditions. This file helps you see the patterns so you can reinforce what works and break what doesn't.

## How to Use This File

**Add to this file:**
- After every annual review (major patterns from the year)
- After every quarterly review (emerging patterns)
- When you notice a pattern repeating (positive or negative)
- When you upload and review past annual reviews or notes

**Reference this file:**
- Before making major decisions (have you been here before? What happened?)
- During annual planning (what patterns do you want to reinforce or break?)
- When you're stuck (what does your history tell you about how you solve problems?)
- When setting goals (are you setting the same goal you've failed to hit for 3 years?)

## Negative Patterns (Failure Modes & Blind Spots)

**What consistently doesn't work?**

*These are recurring mistakes, failure modes, and blind spots. Naming them is the first step to breaking them.*

### Pattern: [NAME]

**Description:**
*What is this pattern?*

**First observed:**
*When did you first notice this?*

**Evidence:**
*Where have you seen this show up? (Specific examples, years, reviews)*

**Why this happens:**
*What drives this behavior? Fear, habit, blind spot, external pressure?*

**Cost:**
*What has this pattern cost you? (Time, money, energy, relationships, opportunities)*

**How to break it:**
*What specific change would interrupt this pattern?*

**Accountability:**
*How will you know if you're falling into this pattern again? Who or what can catch it?*

## Recurring Themes

**What keeps coming up year after year?**

*Not all recurring themes are patterns — some are ongoing challenges, persistent questions, or evolving areas of focus.*

### Theme: [NAME]

**Description:**

**Years this appeared:**

**Evolution:**
*How has this theme evolved over time? Is it getting better, worse, or staying the same?*

**Current status:**

## Repeated Goals (Goals You Keep Setting But Not Hitting)

**What goals have you set multiple times but failed to achieve?**

*If you've tried to do the same thing for 2-3 years and failed, the problem isn't willpower — it's the approach or the goal itself.*

### Goal: [NAME]

**Years attempted:** [LIST YEARS]

**Why you set this goal:**

**Why you didn't hit it:**

**Pattern:**
*What's the recurring failure mode? Lack of time, wrong approach, not actually important to you, external blockers?*

**Decision:**
- [ ] Try again with a different approach (specify what changes)
- [ ] Abandon this goal (it's not actually important)
- [ ] Reframe this goal (maybe the goal is wrong but the underlying desire is real)

**If trying again, what will you change?**

## How Past Reviews Can Inform This File

If you have old annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes:

1. **Upload them** to `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`
2. **Read through them** looking for:
   - Goals you set repeatedly
   - Feedback you received repeatedly
   - Strengths mentioned multiple times
   - Failures or challenges that recur
   - Themes that appear across multiple years
3. **Extract patterns** and add them to this file
4. **Synthesize** into the Executive Pattern Summary above

## Why This File Matters

Most people repeat the same mistakes because they don't track them.

Most people abandon their strengths because they don't name them.

Most people drift because they don't see the patterns in their own behavior.

**This file is your instruction manual.**

It tells you:
- What works for you (do more of this)
- What doesn't work (stop doing this)
- Where you're blind (get help here)
- What you keep trying but failing (change the approach or let it go)

**Use it. Update it. Trust it.**
